# Raycasting Engine in C++

This is an implementation of a raycasting engine in OpenGL/freeglut. Levels can be edited by changing\
the '#' symbols in the map string.

Controls:\
W - move forward\
A - turn left\
S - move back \
D - turn right\
Q - strafe left\
E - strafe right\
P - toggle performance mode

Performance mode just changes the shading of the floor. I came up with the shading method in a short time, so while I think
it looks nice, it certainly isn't optimized very well and can reduce performance.
